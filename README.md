# MyReads Project

This is one of my Front End Web Developer NanoDegree Project of Udacity in React. This project can be used to search for book titles and store them on different shelves depending on what you are currently reading, what you have read and what you would like to read.

## Installation
In order to install and use this project you must run two commands in the console.

1. npm install
2. npm start

These two commands will install all of the dependencies needed for this project and will start the server

## Backend Server
The provided file BooksAPI.js contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend, such as :
* getting collection of book objects.
* updating book shelf.
* Search for books  :

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your search don't come back with any results.
